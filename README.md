- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jacobandwood
- 👀 I’m interested in Human Resources Technology. We create a lot of data in recruitment and there are a million manual, routine and monotonous processes still carried out by highly educated people.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about AI, Machine Learning and Neural Networks. I have no programming experience. I will start with some very light and basic Python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on HR technology companies that are disrupting the war on talent. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Linkedin is best. I have to here for my job!
